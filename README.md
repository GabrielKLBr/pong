# Pong
Pong made with raylib. but... I don't think that this is normal.

You should check it out.

# Compiling
Add the raylib w64devkit "includes", "lib" into your default MinGW installation.

Now go to the project folder and run ```make```

That's all.

If you're having trouble, just download the compiled version from the ```Releases``` page.
